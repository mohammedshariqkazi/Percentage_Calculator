    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>What is a percentage?</h3>
    <p>
      Percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. It is 
      commonly used to represent a portion of a whole or to compare two numbers. 
      Percentages are often denoted with the symbol "%". For example, if there 
      are 100 cars in a garage and 25 of them are white, we could say that 
      25% of the cars in the garage are white.
    </p>

    <h3>How do you calculate a percentage?</h3>
    <p>
      To calculate a percentage, you typically divide the part (the smaller value) 
      by the whole (the larger value), and then multiply the result by 100. This 
      gives you the percentage value as a number between 0 and 100. For example, 
      if you have 50 apples and you want to know what percentage of them are red, 
      and 20 of them are red, you would divide 20 by 50 to get 0.4, then multiply
      by 100 to get 40%.
    </p>

    <h3>Why percentages matter?</h3>
    <p>
      Percentages are used in a wide variety of contexts, from calculating
      discounts and taxes to measuring changes in stock prices and economic 
      indicators. Understanding how percentages work can help you make more 
      informed decisions in a variety of areas, from personal finance to
      business management.
